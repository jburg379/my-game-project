About the game:
You’re a young adventurer that was out on a quest and stepped on a trap that teleported you to the Hero’s Dungeon. 
You have never been to this dungeon, but you know it’s legend. 
This is the dungeon which only the Hero of the world can clear. 
The goal is to exit this dungeon without reaching the boss room. 
However, the maze at every level makes it hard for you to find the exit that every level of the dungeon has.

Warning:
The game is an adventure genre game and contains violence (rated: PG-13).
As such, under 13 should not be playing this game without parental consent and oversight!
